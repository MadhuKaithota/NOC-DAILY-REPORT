Second Shift Update (03-01-25): 
- Ujjivan Konagarayapalaiyam: The WAN link was down. Called the LPOC and performed the FLT but the WAN link was still not working. Then followed up with the ISP and they     informed me that there was an issue with the circuit board. Same has been updated in GLPI.
- Ujjivan Keshiyari: Both links were down. Called the LPOC and performed the FLT. The SIM came up but the WAN link was still down. Then contacted the ISP and they are investigating the issue. The WAN link was down because the cable was not properly connected. Now both links are up and working fine. Same has been updated in GLPI.
